# Project Log

We will use this file to document our weekly meetings and progress/notes. 

Each entry should have a date and assocaited notes eg.

## Date: Tuesday November 30, 2021:

### Notes:
Esben and Ben worked on tieing the block group data to zip codes. Prath worked on making maps in python that highlighted which block groups were above or below various threshold for demographic data. Allison worked on producing zoomable html street maps with block group heatmaps overlayed. Ben created zoomable html maps with popup markers on the block groups with the least internet and least broadband access; when clicked, the block group demographic information pops up. 

## Date: Tuesday November 16, 2021

### Notes
Prathana worked on downloading more data and processed it into a format to be ready to be feed into a Machine learning model. Esben worked on organizing and presenting our results, as well as understanding more of the variables we want to include in the model. Allison made additional figures and maps comparing different variables together. Ben built a regression model.

## DATE: Monday Nov 8, 2021

### Notes

Esben & Prathana explored demographic information related to block groups that lacked internet access. Allison produced maps for all internet variables and counties. Ben looked into mapping block groups onto zip-codes and planned the model we would like to build to better understand the relationship between demographic information and internet access within block groups.



## DATE: Wed Nov 11, 2021

### Notes

Allison and I worked on navigating the census data api and plotting the graphs on the county level. Esben and Prathana worked on plotting them on a block level. 
Team put together deliverable one, and have decided on a mult-target regression machine learning proof of concept model as a first step in our development pipeline.  

### Progress

Will be updated this Wednesday after our meeting. 

### Goals / Next steps

1. Feature engineering/ predicitng by block level and associated independent features 
2. Preprocessing data (Scaling etc. )
3. Building the pipeline for preliminary results on our proof of concept.
